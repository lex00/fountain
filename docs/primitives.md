# The four primitives

Everything in Fountain is built from four concepts.

---

## Environment

An **Environment** is a named, reusable baseline for a coding agent:

- **Encrypted secrets** - key/value env vars, encrypted per-tenant with AES-256-GCM. Write-only: once stored, the API never returns a value (listing returns keys and timestamps only).
- **Plain env vars** - a non-secret `env_vars` map for values that aren't sensitive (feature flags, endpoints). Returned by the API as-is; put anything sensitive in secrets instead.
- **Runtime config** - packages to install, repos to clone, a setup script
- **Networking policy** - `networking_type: unrestricted` or `limited`, with an optional `networking_config` map refining what `limited` allows

Environments attach to Agents at creation time. Many agents can share one environment.

```yaml
apiVersion: fountain.dev/v1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: python-data-env
spec:
  packages:
    python: "3.12"
  networking_type: limited
  secrets:
    - key: OPENAI_API_KEY
      value: sk-...   # encrypted at rest, never returned by the API
```

---

## Vault

A **Vault** is a free-floating bag of env-var overrides.

**Key rule: vault values win on key collision.** When Fountain materializes env vars for a conversation, it merges `environment secrets -> vault secrets`. The vault always takes precedence.

Typical uses: per-customer API keys, staging vs. production credentials, temporary overrides.

```yaml
apiVersion: fountain.dev/v1
kind: Vault
metadata:
  name: staging-creds
spec:
  secrets:
    - key: DATABASE_URL
      value: postgres://staging-host/mydb
```

---

## Agent

An **Agent** is a named, re-runnable configuration for an AI coding assistant:

- **`model`** - `provider/model-id` (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- **`runtime`** - one of `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`
- **`environment`** - optional Environment to attach
- **`system`** / **`description`** - system prompt and human-readable description
- **`skills`** - each entry is either inline (`{name, content}` — a full SKILL.md written to the sandbox) or GitHub-sourced (`{source: "owner/repo"}` — installed via the skills.sh CLI)
- **`mcp_servers`** - MCP server definitions, with `${VAR}` substitution in their env
- **`metadata`** - free-form map for callers' own bookkeeping

```yaml
apiVersion: fountain.dev/v1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: researcher
spec:
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
  runtime: claude
  environment: python-data-env
  skills:
    - source: BinaryBourbon/fountain-api-skill
  mcp_servers:
    github:
      command: npx
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
      env:
        GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: "${GITHUB_PAT}"
```

`${GITHUB_PAT}` is a substitution reference resolved from the merged env + vault secrets at spawn time.

---

## Conversation

A **Conversation** is a running session of an Agent inside a sandboxed VM. It starts with one prompt and can continue over multiple turns:

1. POST to `/api/conversations` with `agent_id` (and optional `vault_id`, `prompt`, `images`)
2. Fountain resolves the full env-var set and spawns a Sprites sandbox
3. The agent runs; log events stream in real time over SSE (`GET /api/conversations/:id/stream`)
4. Follow-up prompts go to `POST /api/conversations/:id/prompts`; a running turn can be interrupted (`POST .../interrupt`) and the whole conversation ended early (`POST .../terminate`)
5. The sandbox exits when the conversation terminates or a timeout hits

### Status lifecycle

```
pending -> running -> completed
                  -> failed
                  -> timed_out
```

---

## Substitution

All string values in Agent configs support `${VAR}` interpolation:

| Syntax | Result |
|---|---|
| `${VAR}` | Value of `VAR` from the merged env map |
| `$$` | Literal `$` |

Substitution is recursive (works inside maps and lists) and fail-complete - all missing variables are reported at once.
