defmodule Fountain.SpriteSkills do
  @moduledoc """
  Materialize an agent's skills onto its sprite at provision time.

  Each entry in `skills` is one of:

    * `%{"name" => name, "content" => skill_md}` — inline. Written
      directly to `<runtime.skills_root>/<name>/SKILL.md`.
    * `%{"source" => "owner/repo", "ref" => optional, "name" => optional}` —
      github. Installed via the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) CLI on the
      sprite: `npx -y skills@latest add <source>[@<ref>] --global --agent
      <runtime-agent> --yes [--skill <name>]`. A `ref` (tag, branch, or sha)
      pins the install; without one the repo's default branch is used at
      spawn time. Each runtime declares its own `skills_sh_agent` so the
      CLI writes to the right on-disk layout.

  The bundled `fountain` skill at `priv/sprite_skills/fountain/SKILL.md` is
  always prepended as an inline skill — it's how the per-conversation callback
  API gets discovered inside the sprite.

  This must run before the network policy locks the sprite down: github
  installs hit npm + GitHub. Inside `mount/3` the github installs run
  before the inline writes — `Sprites.cmd` blocks until the sprite is
  fully ready, which is the readiness gate the HTTP `/fs/*` endpoints
  silently need too.
